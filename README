DESCRIPTION
    Class::DBI::Sweet provides convenient count, search, page, and cache
    functions in a sweet package. It integrates these functions with
    "Class::DBI" in a convenient and efficient way.

RETRIEVING OBJECTS
    All retrieving methods can take the same criteria and attributes.
    Criteria is the only required parameter.

  criteria
    Can be a hash, hashref, or an arrayref. Takes the same options as the
    SQL::Abstract "where" method. If values contain any objects, they will
    be deflated before querying the database.

  attributes
    case, cmp, convert, and logic
        These attributes are passed to SQL::Abstract's constuctor and alter
        the behavior of the criteria.

            { cmp => 'like' }

    order_by
        Specifies the sort order of the results.

            { order_by => 'created_on DESC' }

    rows
        Specifies the maximum number of rows to return. Currently supported
        RDBMs are Interbase, MaxDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite. For other
        RDBMs, it will be emulated.

            { rows => 10 }

    offset
        Specifies the offset of the first row to return. Defaults to 0 if
        unspecified.

            { offset => 0 }

    page
        Specifies the current page in "page". Defaults to 1 if unspecified.

            { page => 1 }

    prefetch
        Specifies a listref of relationships to prefetch. These must be
        has_a or might_haves or Sweet will throw an error. This will cause
        Sweet to do a join across to the related tables in order to return
        the related object without a second trip to the database. All
        'Essential' columns of the foreign table are retrieved.

            { prefetch => [ qw/some_rel some_other_rel/ ] }

        Sweet constructs the joined SQL statement by aliasing the columns in
        each table and prefixing the column name with 'sweet__N_' where N is
        a counter starting at 1. Note that if your database has a column
        length limit (for example, Oracle's limit is 30) and you use long
        column names in your application, Sweet's addition of at least 9
        extra characters to your column name may cause database errors.

    use_resultset_cache
        Enables the resultset cache. This is a little experimental and
        massive gotchas may rear their ugly head at some stage, but it does
        seem to work pretty well.

        For best results, the resultset cache should only be used
        selectively on queries where you experience performance problems.
        Enabling it for every single query in your application will most
        likely cause a drop in performance as the cache overhead is greater
        than simply fetching the data from the database.

    profile_cache
        Records cache hits/misses and what keys they were for in
        ->profiling_data. Note that this is class metadata so if you don't
        want it to be global for Sweet you need to do

            __PACKAGE__->profiling_data({ });

        in either your base class or your table classes to taste.

    disable_sql_paging
        Disables the use of paging in SQL statements if set, forcing Sweet
        to emulate paging by slicing the iterator at the end of ->search
        (which it normally only uses as a fallback mechanism). Useful for
        testing or for causing the entire query to be retrieved initially
        when the resultset cache is used.

        This is also useful when using custom SQL via "set_sql" and setting
        "sql_method" (see below) where a COUNT(*) may not make sense (i.e.
        when the COUNT(*) might be as expensive as just running the full
        query and just slicing the iterator).

    sql_method
        This sets the name of the sql fragment to use as previously set by a
        "set_sql" call. The default name is "Join_Retrieve" and the
        associated default sql fragment set in this class is:

            __PACKAGE__->set_sql( Join_Retrieve => <<'SQL' );
            SELECT __ESSENTIAL(me)__%s
            FROM   %s
            WHERE  %s
            SQL

        You may override this in your table or base class using the same
        name and CDBI::Sweet will use your custom fragment, instead.

        If you need to use more than one sql fragment in a given class you
        may create a new sql fragment and then specify its name using the
        "sql_method" attribute.

        The %s strings are replaced by sql parts as described in Ima::DBI.
        See "statement_order" for the sql part that replaces each instance
        of %s.

        In addition, the associated statment for COUNT(*) statement has
        "_Count" appended to the sql_method name. Only "from" and "where"
        are passed to the sprintf function.

        The default sql fragment used for "Join_Retrieve" is:

            __PACKAGE__->set_sql( Join_Retrieve_Count => <<'SQL' );
            SELECT COUNT(*)
            FROM   %s
            WHERE  %s
            SQL

        If you create a custom sql method (and set the "sql_method"
        attribute) then you will likely need to also create an associated
        _Count fragment. If you do not have an associated _Count, and wish
        to call the "page" method, then set "disable_sql_paging" to true and
        your result set from the select will be spliced to return the page
        you request.

        Here's an example.

        Assume a CD has_a Artist (and thus Artists have_many CDs), and you
        wish to return a list of artists and how many CDs each have:

        In package MyDB::Artist

            __PACKAGE__->columns( TEMP => 'cd_count');

            __PACKAGE__->set_sql( 'count_by_cd', <<'');
                SELECT      __ESSENTIAL(me)__, COUNT(cds.cdid) as cd_count
                FROM        %s                  -- ("from")
                WHERE       %s                  -- ("where")
                GROUP BY    __ESSENTIAL(me)__
                %s %s                           -- ("limit" and "order_by")

        Then in your application code:

            my ($pager, $iterator) = MyDB::Artist->page(
                {
                    'cds.title'    => { '!=', undef },
                },
                {
                    sql_method          => 'count_by_cd',
                    statement_order     => [qw/ from where limit order_by / ],
                    disable_sql_paging  => 1,
                    order_by            => 'cd_count desc',
                    rows                => 10,
                    page                => 1,
                } );

        The above generates the following SQL:

            SELECT      me.artistid, me.name, COUNT(cds.cdid) as cd_count
            FROM        artist me, cd cds
            WHERE       ( cds.title IS NOT NULL ) AND me.artistid = cds.artist
            GROUP BY    me.artistid, me.name
            ORDER BY    cd_count desc

        The one caveat is that Sweet cannot figure out the has_many joins
        unless you specify them in the $criteria. In the previous example
        that's done by asking for all cd titles that are not null (which
        should be all).

        To fetch a list like above but limited to cds that were created
        before the year 2000, you might do:

            my ($pager, $iterator) = MyDB::Artist->page(
                {
                    'cds.year'  => { '<', 2000 },
                },
                {
                    sql_method          => 'count_by_cd',
                    statement_order     => [qw/ from where limit order_by / ],
                    disable_sql_paging  => 1,
                    order_by            => 'cd_count desc',
                    rows                => 10,
                    page                => 1,
                } );

    statement_order
        Specifies a list reference of SQL parts that are replaced in the SQL
        fragment (which is defined with "sql_method" above). The available
        SQL parts are:

            prefetch_cols from where order_by limit sql prefetch_names

        The "sql" part is shortcut notation for these three combined:

            where order_by limit

        Prefecch_cols are the columns selected when a prefetch is speccified
        -- use in the SELECT. Prefetch_names are just the column names for
        use in GROUP BY.

        This is useful when statement order needs to be changed, such as
        when using a GROUP BY:

  count
    Returns a count of the number of rows matching the criteria. "count"
    will discard "offset", "order_by", and "rows".

        $count = MyApp::Article->count(%criteria);

  search
    Returns an iterator in scalar context, or an array of objects in list
    context.

        @objects  = MyApp::Article->search(%criteria);

        $iterator = MyApp::Article->search(%criteria);

  search_like
    As search but adds the attribute { cmp => 'like' }.

  page
    Retuns a page object and an iterator. The page object is an instance of
    Data::Page.

        ( $page, $iterator )
            = MyApp::Article->page( $criteria, { rows => 10, page => 2 );

        printf( "Results %d - %d of %d Found\n",
            $page->first, $page->last, $page->total_entries );

  pager
    An alias to page.

  retrieve_all
    Same as "Class::DBI" with addition that it takes "attributes" as
    arguments, "attributes" can be a hash or a hashref.

        $iterator = MyApp::Article->retrieve_all( order_by => 'created_on' );

  retrieve_next
    Returns the next record after the current one according to the order_by
    attribute (or primary key if no order_by specified) matching the
    criteria. Must be called as an object method.

  retrieve_previous
    As retrieve_next but retrieves the previous record.

CACHING OBJECTS
    Objects will be stored deflated in cache. Only "Primary" and "Essential"
    columns will be cached.

  cache
    Class method: if this is set caching is enabled. Any cache object that
    has a "get", "set", and "remove" method is supported.

        __PACKAGE__->cache(
            Cache::FastMmap->new(
                share_file => '/tmp/cdbi',
                expire_time => 3600
            )
        );

  cache_key
    Returns a cache key for an object consisting of class and primary keys.

  Overloaded methods
    _init
        Overrides "Class::DBI"'s internal cache. On a cache hit, it will
        return a cached object; on a cache miss it will create an new object
        and store it in the cache.

    create
    insert
        All caches for this table are marked stale and will be re-cached on
        next retrieval. create is an alias kept for backwards compability.

    retrieve
        On a cache hit the object will be inflated by the "select" trigger
        and then served.

    update
        Object is removed from the cache and will be cached on next
        retrieval.

    delete
        Object is removed from the cache.

UNIVERSALLY UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS
    If enabled a UUID string will be generated for primary column. A
    CHAR(36) column is suitable for storage.

        __PACKAGE__->sequence('uuid');
